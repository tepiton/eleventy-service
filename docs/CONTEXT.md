# Current Focus

Foundation build complete: section engine, page layout, mimeo deploy
manifest, and centralized branding are all in and verified. Published
to tepiton/eleventy-service and living in TEMPLATES/ - nothing open in
this repo.

# Active Tasks

None open in this repo.

# Context

- Section engine, design system, and demo content are in and verified
  (clean build, schema fires on bad front matter, no stray section
  pages, css fully inlined per page)
- Subpages use layouts/page.njk (hero + stats/cards/projects blocks),
  shared with eleventy-product - keep them in sync
- Branding (email, accent palette) is centralized in metadata.js; a
  rebrand is a one-file edit (see DEC-S5)
- Demo prose renders through nunjucks so it interpolates
  {{ metadata.title }} where frontmatter can't (see DEC-S6)
- Demo brand: Harborlight Studio (placeholder, de-personalized)
- Warm palette variant; cool variant lives in eleventy-product

# Next Session
